// Three in one
// Describe how to use a single array to implement three stack

int main(){
	/*
	Partition the array into three sections. Each partition will prepresent a
	stack. Have "pointer" variables keep track of the top of each stack. At
	each push/pop, increment/decrement the pointers. Set limits so that 
	pointers can't go outside of their partitions. 
	Alternatively, could have dynamic stack sizes, where pointers can go 
	outside of their partitions. Would need to have checks to make sure that
	they don't cross over each other.
